Joce Boss Boutique

Joce Boss Boutique is a clothing company run on Instagram, the company asked
for creators to make different logos for her company based on witchcraft, zombies, spells, etc.

I came up with a circular design filled with themed words such as "creative" "spells" "power" etc Along with an eyeball hand and pentagram to go along with the witch theme of the contest
